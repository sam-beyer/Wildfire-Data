# Wildfire-Data
DATA 360 Group Project

This project was created in Dr. Forrest Stonedahl's Data 360 course
at Augustana College along side Sam Daly and Nick Mosele. The goal of
the projects was to create a machine learning program to either predict
or classify a dataset. We chose to look at a data set that included
every wildfire in the United States from 2005 to 2016. The data set 
included the year of the fire, longitude of fire, latitude of fire, 
cause of fire, discovery date, state where fire occurred, size of 
the fire, and class of the fire. We combined this data set with 
climate and weather data from the months in which the fires occured
in order to predict the size of a wildfire based on the climate, 
cause, location and weather at the time of the start of the fire.
